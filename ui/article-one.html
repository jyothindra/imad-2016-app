                India is my country and in India the future of a child is the dreams of their parents <br>
                But parents never understand the true fellings of their children and his dreams .They<br>
                keep on saying you have to become some _ _ _ ,but never ask "what you want to be" and <br>
                and does not look into his talents.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a boy is doing something the is not usual something waste of time but useful,<br>  
            they parents never support him insted they say "see other childern and learn from them"<br>
            at that time he think that he was doing something wrong ,but actuall it is not and there<br>
            many situations like that they keep on decreasing boundaries of the child.Because of this<br>
            the mentality of child will be like to work under someone and does not develop mentality to<br>
            bulid his own empire or somethig like compay or like fly in colors in his field of intrest<br>

            <p>
            I say that by changing our parents mentality we can atleast change <br>
            a little future of India .I hope when it comes to our turn as a elder we should not bo the same<br>
            done by our parents <br>
                                "LET BIRD FLY IN SKY NOT IN CAGE"
